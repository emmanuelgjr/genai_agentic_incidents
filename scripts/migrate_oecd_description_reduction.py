One-off migration: retroactively apply the OECD AIM narrative-description
reduction (docs/audits/E21-oecd-narrative-licence-2026-07-30.md, outcome (B))
to the already-committed OECD ingest snapshot(s), so the fix reaches every
row already fetched -- including the 40 rows that have aged out of OECD's
own sitemap and can never be re-fetched again by the normal ingest path --
without a costly, CI-infeasible full re-ingest (E21 §5.4: the live sitemap
holds 10,000 incident URLs, ``ingest/_cache/oecd_aim/`` is empty and
gitignored, and a cold OECD_AIM_LIMIT=0 pass has a ~167-minute floor against
``auto-refresh.yml``'s 60-minute timeout).

For each row in each target file:
  1. captures the row's CURRENT (pre-reduction) ``description`` as the
     corpus-classification seed -- exactly the text
     ``merge_and_dedupe.py``'s ``_classify_corpus()`` would have read this
     build if nothing changed, so the persisted ``corpus`` is byte-identical
     to what would have shipped anyway (0 unintended moves; see
     ``ingest_oecd_aim.py::classify_corpus_signal()``'s own docstring);
  2. persists ``corpus`` from that seed;
  2b. if the row's ``attack_vector`` is "other", also re-runs the SAME
     title+narrative reclassification ``merge_and_dedupe.py``'s own
     normalize_entry()/step-4b finalize would otherwise perform against the
     (about-to-be-reduced) ``description`` -- an independent cascade found
     by dry-running this migration once and diffing: reducing `description`
     first regressed 178/4160 rows' `attack_vector` back to "other" (and
     rippled into owasp_llm/owasp_asi/nist_ai_rmf/mitre_atlas via
     fill_taxonomy()). Same fix as `corpus`: seed from the pre-reduction
     text, persist a definitive value, so merge_and_dedupe's own
     reclassify-if-"other" guards never fire post-migration. See
     ``ingest_oecd_aim.py::reclassify_attack_vector_from_narrative()``;
  3. overwrites ``description`` with the same structural template the
     ingest-time fix now produces.

Both the classifier and the template builder are IMPORTED from
``ingest_oecd_aim.py`` (gate advisory, E21 §5.4/§5.6-adjacent) rather than
reimplemented here, so the retroactive path and the forward-fetch path can
never structurally diverge.

Pure transform of a committed ``ingest/*.json`` artifact -- no network call,
no model call, no touch to any ``data/*.json`` output (those are build
artifacts, never hand-edited; ``ingest/*.json`` files are inputs, and this
script plays the same role an ingest script's own output normally would).
Run once, by hand, outside ``make build``:

    python scripts/migrate_oecd_description_reduction.py [path...]

Defaults to ``ingest/oecd_aim_full_incidents.json`` if no path is given.
